# Images Directory

With our code-generated space elements, we've significantly reduced the number of images needed. Here are the only images you might still want to include:

## Minecraft Projects (Optional)
1. `texture-pack1.jpg` - Preview image of your Minecraft texture pack
2. `build1.jpg` - Image of your Minecraft build

## Personal Avatar (Optional)
3. `profile-pic.jpg` - Your professional headshot or avatar (optional - can use CSS-based initials instead)

## Alternative Options
Instead of using images, our site now uses:
- CSS-generated astronaut animation
- CSS-generated spaceship
- JavaScript-generated stars and shooting stars
- CSS-generated planets and orbits
- CSS gradients for cards without images
- CSS-based avatar with initials

If you want to add any images, make sure they are optimized for web (compressed) to ensure fast loading times.
